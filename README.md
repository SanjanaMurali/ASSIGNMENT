This contains answers to following questions in python.

 1.How to find the missing number in given integer array of 1 to 100?
 
 2.Given a String of length N reverse the words in it. Words are separated by 
   space without using any library method.
   
 3.The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,12 + 22 + ... + 
   102=385. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ...
    + 10)2 = 552 = 3025. Hence the difference between the sum of the squares 
    of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 =   2640.
    
 4.Find  the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
 natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 
 5.If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 4 or 5, we get 
   4, 5, and 8. The sum of these multiples is 17. Find the sum of all the multiples
   of 4 or 5 below 1000.
   
 6.The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.Find the sum of all the 
   primes below two million
