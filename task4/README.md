SUM OF ALL MULTIPLES OF 4 & 5 BELOW 1000

This is a python program to find sum of multiples of 4 and 5 below 1000

Prerequisties:
 1.This can be run on ubuntu 16.04 using command :
   python file name
   
Logic:

  999/4=249
  999/5=199
  999/20=49
  Find sum of natural numbers upto 249 and multiply it with 4 to get sum of multiples 
  within 1000 and do the same for 5 also.
  Since 20 is divisible by both 4 and 5, multiples of 20 within 1000 have to be
  subtracted to get the correct sum.
